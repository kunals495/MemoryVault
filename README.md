# MemoryVault: Time Capsule Creator

## Overview 

The "MemoryVault" is an innovative Java-based desktop application designed to allow users to create, store, and revisit digital time capsules containing personal memories, goals, images, and notes, which are locked until a user-specified future date. Built using JavaFX for a rich graphical user interface (GUI), SQLite for data persistence, and incorporating basic encryption techniques, this project combines emotional storytelling with practical utility, making it a unique tool for personal reflection, motivation, and legacy preservation. The application is highly customizable, user-friendly, and offers a nostalgic yet modern experience, appealing to a wide range of users from individuals to families and even small teams.

## Tech stack

**Programming Language**: Java (JDK 17+)

**Framework**: JavaFX for GUI development, providing a cross-platform desktop experience.

**Database**: SQLite for lightweight, local data storage, with a table schema including id, title, memory, unlock_date, and image_path columns.

**Libraries**:
sqlite-jdbc for SQLite connectivity.

JavaFX controls and media libraries for UI and image handling.

**Encryption**: Base64 encoding for memory text (a basic security measure; advanced encryption like AES can be added).

**Dependencies**: Managed via manual JAR inclusion or Maven for easier setup.

## Use Case in Real Life
**Personal Memories Preservation**: Users can store life events (e.g., wedding photos, travel notes) and revisit them years later.

**Goal Setting & Motivation**: Track personal goals (e.g., fitness progress with "before" photos) and review achievements on a set date.

**Gifts for Loved Ones**: Create surprise capsules with messages and images for birthdays or anniversaries.

**Journaling with Insights**: Record dreams or thoughts and analyze mood patterns after a period.

**Business Milestones**: Teams can document project starts and review progress upon completion.

**Legacy for Future Generations**: Parents can leave stories and photos for their children to unlock decades later.

**Creative Projects**: Artists can save drafts and review them after a creative break.

**Event Planning**: Store event details (e.g., wedding plans) and check them close to the date.
